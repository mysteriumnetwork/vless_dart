package XRay

// The supported feature set, and nothing else.
//
// Xray-core registers protocols and transports through init() side effects, so
// this import list IS the contract: VLESS over WebSocket + TLS, with a local
// SOCKS inbound. Adding a protocol or transport means editing this file, which
// makes it a visible, reviewable change.
//
// Deliberately absent: XHTTP, SplitHTTP, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC, QUIC, mKCP,
// REALITY, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, WireGuard, DNS and routing. Keeping them
// out holds the binary and the runtime footprint down, which matters because an
// iOS Network Extension is jetsam-killed past roughly 50 MB.
//
// Never fall back to main/distro/all; that defeats the entire design.
